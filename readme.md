Create a [`vfile`][vfile] from a filepath.
Optionally populates them from the file system as well.
Can write virtual files to file system too.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c):
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install to-vfile
```

## Use

```js
import {toVFile} from 'to-vfile'

console.log(toVFile('readme.md'))
console.log(toVFile(new URL('./readme.md', import.meta.url)))
console.log(toVFile.readSync('.git/HEAD'))
console.log(toVFile.readSync('.git/HEAD', 'utf8'))
```

Yields:

```js
VFile {
  data: {},
  messages: [],
  history: ['readme.md'],
  cwd: '/Users/tilde/projects/oss/to-vfile'
}
VFile {
  data: {},
  messages: [],
  history: ['readme.md'],
  cwd: '/Users/tilde/projects/oss/to-vfile'
}
VFile {
  data: {},
  messages: [],
  history: ['.git/HEAD'],
  cwd: '/Users/tilde/projects/oss/to-vfile',
  value: <Buffer 72 65 66 3a 20 72 65 66 73 2f 68 65 61 64 73 2f 6d 61 73 74 65 72 0a>
}
VFile {
  data: {},
  messages: [],
  history: ['.git/HEAD'],
  cwd: '/Users/tilde/projects/oss/to-vfile',
  value: 'ref: refs/heads/main\n'
}
```

## API

This package exports the following identifiers: `toVFile`.
There is no default export.

### `toVFile(options)`

Create a virtual file.
Works like the [vfile][] constructor, except when `options` is `string` or
`Buffer`, in which case it’s treated as `{path: options}` instead of
`{value: options}`, or when `options` is a WHATWG `URL` object, in which case
it’s treated as `{path: fileURLToPath(options)}`.

### `toVFile.read(options[, encoding][, callback])`

Creates a virtual file from options (`toVFile(options)`), reads the file from
the file system and populates `file.value` with the result.
If `encoding` is specified, it’s passed to `fs.readFile`.
If `callback` is given, invokes it with either an error or the populated virtual
file.
If `callback` is not given, returns a [`Promise`][promise] that is rejected with
an error or resolved with the populated virtual file.

### `toVFile.readSync(options[, encoding])`

Like `toVFile.read` but synchronous.
Either throws an error or returns a populated virtual file.

### `toVFile.write(options[, fsOptions][, callback])`

Creates a virtual file from `options` (`toVFile(options)`), writes the file to
the file system.
`fsOptions` are passed to `fs.writeFile`.
If `callback` is given, invokes it with an error, if any.
If `callback` is not given, returns a [`Promise`][promise] that is rejected with
an error or resolved with the written virtual file.

### `toVFile.writeSync(options[, fsOptions])`

Like `toVFile.write` but synchronous.
Either throws an error or returns a populated virtual file.
